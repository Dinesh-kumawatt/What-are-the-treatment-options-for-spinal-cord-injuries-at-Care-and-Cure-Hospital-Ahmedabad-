Spinal cord injuries (SCI) are life-altering events that require immediate and expert medical intervention. These injuries can result from trauma, such as road accidents or falls, or from medical conditions like tumors or infections. Symptoms may include paralysis, loss of sensation, difficulty breathing, or impaired bowel and bladder control. Treatment begins with stabilizing the spine and preventing further damage through medications like steroids or surgical decompression. Once stabilized, patients undergo physical therapy, occupational therapy, and sometimes nerve regeneration treatments. At Care and Cure Hospital Ahmedabad, the neurosurgical and rehabilitation teams work together to provide holistic, long-term care plans tailored to the severity and location of the injury. The hospital offers state-of-the-art diagnostic imaging, advanced surgical options, and intensive neuro-rehab facilities, making it a reliable choice for SCI recovery. Their goal is to help patients regain as much independence and quality of life as possible. For more details, visit:
